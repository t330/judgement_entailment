    # Judging entailment between Japanese sentences
    prompt = """
    Produce the results of entailment judgment between a pairs of Japanese sentences.
    Here is the example of how you evaluate a pair of sentences.
    If you are given the following JSON array as input:
    [{"sentence1": "私は猫が大好きだ。", "sentence2": "猫が好きです。"}, {"sentence1": "天気が良いですね。", "sentence2": "あの人は美しいです。"}, {"sentence1": "明日、会いに行くつもりです。", "sentence2": "明日、魚を食べるつもりです。"}]
    You need to evaluate how much semantically similar a pair of Japanese sentences of each object in this array is and return the result of each object as the following:
    [{"label": "ENTAIL", "score": 0.90}, {"label": "NO_ENTAIL", "score": 0.30}, {"label": "NO_ENTAIL", "score": 0.40}]
    label has ENTAIL whose score is greater than or equal to 0.80, or NO_ENTAIL whose score is less than 0.80.
    score is a decimal fraction between 0.00 and 1.00, where 0.00 is completely not semantically similar. and 1.00 is completely semantically similar.
    score must be given with decimal franctions from 0.00 to 1.00 and do not include any other characters.
    These results indicate that the first pair of sentences is semantically similar with ENTAIL and a score of 0.90, the second pair is not semantically similar with NO_ENTAIL and a score of 0.30 and the third pair is not semantically similar with NO_ENTAIL and a score of 0.40.
    These scores are just an example, so you need to evaluate the actual semantic similarity of each pair of sentences.
    The number of objects in the input JSON array can be from 1 to 100, so please evaluate all pairs of sentences in the input JSON array and return the results as a JSON array including the same number of objects.
    Now here is the input JSON array:
    """ + json.dumps(sentenceArray, ensure_ascii=False)
    try:
        response = ollama.chat(
            model='mistral',
            messages=[

                    'role': 'user',
                    'content': prompt,
                },
            ],
            format=ResultList.model_json_schema(),
        )
        print('Entailment checker\'s response:', response['message']['content'].strip())
        content = response['message']['content'].strip()
        parsed_content = json.loads(content)
        return JsonResponse(parsed_content)
    
    except Exception as e:
        return JsonResponse({'error': f"Error connecting to Ollama: {e}. Make sure Ollama is running locally."})
